# KCHPLATFORM

A project management web application created for future use of future interns of Knowledge Channel Foundation Inc.  
Main features of this web application includes a messaging system, an alert notification system, file management system and grading system.  
  
My personal contribution for this project is the full stack development of both intern system and the administrator system.
